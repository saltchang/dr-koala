- This project is "Dr. Koala", an AI-powered web application for answering users' questions by searching the web.
- This project is a simpler version of Perplexity with only minimal features.
- This project is a MVP level project for introducing the multi-agent architecture and LLM-based application development.

Dr. Koala uses multi-agent architecture for different tasks:

- **Intention & Planning Agent**: For understanding the user's intentions, questions, and requirements by analyzing the user's input then planning the search, analysis, and generation tasks. Adjust the current and processing plan if needed.
- **Search and Analysis Agent**: For searching the web according to the plan. Analyze the search results and generate indexable content.
- **Generation Agent**: For generating the final answer based on the analyzed and indexed content.
- **Review Agent**: For reviewing the outcomes and decide whether to perform the optimization tasks or start another process to improve the outcome.

The prompt templates for the agents are stored in the `app/core/constant/agent_configs.toml` file.

- Dr. Koala uses the grok-4-fast-reasoning model from xAI for AI agents. The API key is stored as `XAI_API_KEY`.
- Dr. Koala uses the Brave Search API to search the web. The API key is stored as `BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY`.
